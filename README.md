Please feel free to download PolypGen dataset by using https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn26376615/wiki/613312

The dataset contains still images, video sequences, positive-only frames, and negative-only frames from 6 medical hospitals. It is one of the most comprehensive publicly available datasets. 


The PolypGen dataset is an open-access dataset that comprises 1,537 polyp images, 2,225 positive video sequences, and 4,275 negative frames. The dataset is collected from six different centers in Europe and Africa. Altogether the dataset provides 3,762 positive frames and 4,275 negative frames. These still images and video frames are collected from varied populations, endoscopic systems, and surveillance expert in  Norway, France, United Kingdom, Egypt, and Italy and is one of the comprehensive open-access datasets for polyp detection and segmentation.
